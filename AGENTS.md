# AGENTS.md

Agent-facing guide for `loop-engineering-anything`. Read this before editing.

## What this is

A **loop orchestrator** that turns any target (a service/API or a local
codebase) into a self-improving, agent-native CLI by driving four external tools
around a closed feedback loop: route → generate → judge → refactor → re-judge →
compound. The novel surface is the controller + memory + convergence policy, not
another CLI generator. See `README.md` for the thesis and `docs/plans/` for the
implementation plan.

## Architecture boundaries

- **Wrap, don't fork (KTD1).** The four tools (CLI-Printing-Press, CLI-Anything,
  CLI-Judge, compound-engineering) are installable dependencies invoked behind
  adapters. Never vendor or fork them into this repo.
- **The controller depends only on protocols** in `src/loopeng/adapters/base.py`
  (`Judge`, `Refiner`, `Compounder`, `Checkpoint`, `Factory`). It must never call
  a real external CLI directly — that keeps loop dynamics testable against
  recorded verdicts. Concrete tool bindings live in `src/loopeng/adapters/`.
- **Quality comes only from CLI-Judge (KTD4).** The controller never inspects
  code patterns to judge quality — only the `Verdict` parsed from `report.json`.
- **Safety is unbypassable (KTD5/R3).** A safety-failing verdict is a terminal
  `BLOCKED_SAFETY` state that rolls back and never ships. Do not add a path that
  exits `BLOCKED_SAFETY` into a ship/accept.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/loopeng/config.py` | budgets, convergence knobs, dependency table |
| `src/loopeng/preflight.py` | dependency detection (per-mechanism) |
| `src/loopeng/router.py` | target → lane classification (U3) |
| `src/loopeng/memory/` | SQLite run history + trend/plateau/recurring queries (U2) |
| `src/loopeng/adapters/` | contracts + (incoming) real tool bindings (U4/U5) |
| `src/loopeng/loop/` | controller state machine, convergence, brief, compound (U6) |
| `src/loopeng/autonomous/` | research report; runner is a deferred unit (U8) |
| `skills/loop-anything/` | the `/loop-anything` agent skill |

## Conventions

- Python ≥3.11, Click CLI, `pytest`, stdlib `sqlite3`, dataclasses for contracts.
- Subprocess calls MUST use an args list (never `shell=True` / f-string commands)
  and target input MUST be validated before reaching an adapter.
- Conventional commits. Run `pytest` before committing; CI runs it on every PR.

## Workflow

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
loop-anything preflight
```

Per change that alters behavior: add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `[Unreleased]`
and sync the docs the change touches (README, this file, the plan's tables).

## Open feasibility gates (resolve before binding the live loop)

1. Can `/ce-work` and `/ce-compound` be driven **headlessly** from a long-running
   controller? Blocks the real `Refiner`/`Compounder` bindings.
2. Are **CLI-Judge grades stable** enough across identical re-judges to be a
   control signal? Needs a variance spike before trusting autonomous convergence.

Until resolved, adapter bindings are shells against documented contracts; the
controller core is validated against recorded verdicts.
